In this treatment a few general assumptions are made concerning the behavior of a single individual and of a group of two individuals in certain economic environments. From these, the solution (in the sense of this paper) of the classical problem may be obtained. In the terms of game theory, values are found for the game.},

    abstract = {Two players have to reach an agreement on the partition of a pie of size 1. Each has to make in turn, a proposal as to how it should be divided. After one player has made an offer, the other must decide either to accept it, or to reject it and continue the bargaining. Several properties which the players' preferences possess are assumed. The Perfect Equilibrium Partitions (P.E.P.) are characterized in all the models satisfying these assumptions. Specially, it is proved that when every player bears a fixed bargaining cost for each period (c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>), then: (i) if <latex>$c_{1}<c_{2}$</latex> the only P.E.P. gives all the pie to 1; (ii) if <latex>$c_{1}>c_{2}$</latex> the only P.E.P. gives to 1 only c<sub>2</sub>. In the case where each player has a fixed discounting factor (δ <sub>1</sub> and δ <sub>2</sub>) the only P.E.P. is <tex-math>$(1-\delta _{2})/(1-\delta _{1}\delta _{2})$</tex-math>.},

By multiplying each privately held constraint group by an appropriately generated and privately held random matrix, the original linear program is transformed into an equivalent one that does not reveal any of the privately held data or make it public.
